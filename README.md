# IOS-APP
I wrote this IOS app free time, during the summer of 2015, but did not attempt to publish.  It is based off of the idea of "tagging" your location at a specific event, so that people could know the demographics of the people present at said event.  For example, people could tag themselves at a park, allowing other people to see who is currently at the park.  The tag is automatically removed if the app is turned off or if the phone leaves the area.  The only information the tag provides is age and gender.
